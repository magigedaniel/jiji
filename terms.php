		<h3 class="themeClr">Limitation of Liability/Disclaimer</h3>
        <ul class="mrL2">
        <li>Whilst we will take all reasonable steps to deliver your messages to the recipients as 
fast as possible, we cannot commit to, or guarantee, a specific delivery time. Such 
times depend on various network and system-related factors among the various entities 
involved in the transportation of your messages across the cellular mobile networks.</li>
        
        <li>Furthermore, delivery reports and the originator are operator dependant features and so 
it is not possible for us to give 100% guarantee for their availability. We recommend that 
tests should be conducted beforehand when these features are considered to be of high 
importance.</li>
        
        <li>You acknowledge that as we send and receive text-messages via major 
telecommunication companies and Mobile Network Operators, our influence over the 
transmission of your messages is within the technical constraints imposed upon us.</li>
        
        <li>Our responsibility is therefore to ensure that the text-messages you send through 
the service are processed correctly and delivered to the assigned entity. We are not 
responsible for the final delivery of the message, as this is out of our control and is the 
responsibility of the Mobile Network Operator.</li>
        
        <li>SMS's that cannot be delivered within the lifespan allocated to them, either by us or a 
Mobile Network Operator will be discarded by the Mobile Network Operator, without any 
notice. We are not liable for any loss incurred by the failure of a message to be delivered 
and you acknowledge that damages concerning financial or other loss resulting from 
delivery failure cannot be claimed from Team MSG91. Furthermore, you agree that the 
message contents are deemed to have zero value.</li>
        
        <li>You also acknowledge that text-messages are transmitted unencrypted and that 
eavesdropping of mobile phone communications, including SMS delivery by third parties 
is possible. We also recommend that you ensure sensitive and valuable information is 
communicated by a number of superior communication methods.</li>
        
        <li>Furthermore, use of the service and the Internet is at its own risk and that the service 
is provided "as is" and "as available", without any warranties or conditions whatsoever, 
expressed or implied. We will apply all commercially reasonable efforts to make access 
to the service available through the required access protocols, but make no warranty 
or guarantee that you will be able to access the service at any particular time or any 
particular location. Without limiting the generality of the terms set forth, we and our 
affiliates, agents, content providers, service providers, and licensees hereby disclaim 
all express and implied warranties as to the accuracy, completeness, non-infringement, 
merchantability or fitness for particular purpose of the service generally, and any content 
or services contained therein, as well as all express and implied warranties that the 
operation of the service generally and any contender services contained therein will be 
uninterrupted or error-free.</li>

        <li>We shall in no event be liable for any inaccuracy, error or omission in, or loss, injury 
or damage caused in whole or in part by failures, delays or interruptions of the service 
generally, and any aspect ancillary thereto; you agree to indemnify us for any third party 
claims arising from such failures, delays or interruptions in connection with regard to the 
use of the service.</li>
        
        <li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions outlined above 
are for the benefit of Team MSG91 and its affiliates, agents, content providers and 
service providers and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions 
directly on its own behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        
        <h3 class="themeClr">Modification of terms</h3>
        <p>We frequently update, modify and otherwise continually seek to improve the service and such 
changes often dictate that we simultaneously modify the terms and conditions of use. As such, 
we have the right to modify the terms of this agreement and to change or discontinue any 
aspect or feature of our service, in either case, as it deems reasonably necessary. If you do not 
agree with any such changes, your use of the service may be cancelled in accordance with the 
procedures for cancellation set forth in this agreement. You acknowledge your responsibility to 
review this agreement from time to time and to be aware of any such changes and, should you 
request, we will be happy to keep you informed if/when such changes take place.
Furthermore, you accept that should there be a contradiction between other specific terms and 
conditions and these general terms and conditions, the other specific terms and conditions shall 
apply.</p>


		<h3 class="themeClr">Termination</h3>
        <p>If at any time you breach the terms and conditions of the service, we may elect to suspend, 
terminate and/or cancel this agreement and/or recover any damages from you arising from 
the event(s) giving rise to the suspension, termination or cancellation. We reserve the right 
to suspend your service at any stage for any reason we may deem necessary to continue to 
provide any of our services in a way that may be hindered by your status as being our client, 
your financial status or the content of the messages originating from you.</p>

		<p>Upon any such termination, cancellation and/or suspension, you are still responsible for 
any obligations than accrued. Payment and other obligations under this agreement are not 
suspended, stayed, or otherwise affected by a suspension of access to/or use of the service 
(in whole or in part) where said suspension arises from your failure to comply with, or violation 
of, the terms of this agreement or of any law or legal obligation. Upon termination and/or 
cancellation, for any reason, you agree to immediately cease using the service and we shall 
have no obligation to you after any termination or cancellation of this agreement.</p>

		<p>You are also free to terminate or cancel this agreement at any time, and for any reason. For 
such termination or cancellation to be effective however, you must inform us in writing through 
Email. You will still be under the responsibilities of this agreement for the duration that you used
the service and you will cease to have access to the use of any credits that may exist in your 
account.</p>
		
        <p>Our terms and conditions as well as the prices are subject to change from time to time 
according to TRAI rules and regulations.</p>
